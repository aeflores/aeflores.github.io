title: About me
---

I work at GrammaTech as a senior scientist. My work is focused
on static analysis of programs and more recently on static analysis
of binaries. I am interested in formal methods, programming languages, static
program analysis, and machine learning. Some of my recent work is open source
e.g. https://github.com/GrammaTech/ddisasm.

Before working at GrammaTech, I obtained a PhD in Computer Science at Technical
University of Darmstadt (Germany) under the supervision of [Reiner
HÃ¤hnle](https://www.se.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/se/group-members/reiner-haehnle/).
During my PhD I worked on improving
the techniques for automatic resource analysis (also known as cost
analysis or bound analysis). The results of this research
have been implemented into a prototype tool called [CoFloCo](http://aeflores.github.io/CoFloCo/).

Additionally, I collaborated with the [COSTA
group](http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es) to develop static analyses for
concurrent programs based on concurrent objects (written in the
[ABS](http://abs-models.org/) language).

Before my PhD I studied computer engineering and a master in computer
science research at Complutense University of Madrid. My master thesis
was supervised by  [Elvira
Albert](http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/~elvira/) and [Samir
Genaim](http://samir.fdi.ucm.es/~genaim/).
