title: About me
---


I recently obtained a PhD in Computer Science at Technical
University of Darmstadt (Germany) under the supervision of [Reiner
HÃ¤hnle](https://www.se.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/se/group-members/reiner-haehnle/). I
am interested in formal methods, programming languages, and static
program analysis. In particular, during my PhD I worked on improving
the techniques for automatic resource analysis (also known as cost
analysis or bound analysis). The results of this research
have been implemented into a prototype tool called [CoFloCo](http://aeflores.github.io/CoFloCo/).

Additionally, I collaborated with the [COSTA
group](http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es) to develop static analyses for
concurrent programs based on concurrent objects (written in the
[ABS](http://abs-models.org/) language).  We extended resource
analysis and termination analysis techniques from sequential to
concurrent programs and we also developed concurrency-specific program
analyses, such as a deadlock analysis and a May-Happen-in-Parallel
analysis.

Before my PhD I studied computer engineering and a master in computer
science research at Complutense University of Madrid. My master thesis
was supervised by  [Elvira
Albert](http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/~elvira/) and [Samir
Genaim](http://samir.fdi.ucm.es/~genaim/).
