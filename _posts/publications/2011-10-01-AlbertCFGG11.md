We present jPET, a white box test-case generator (TCG) which can be used during software development of Java applications within the Eclipse environment. jPET builds on top of PET, a TCG which automatically obtains test-cases from the byte code associated to a Java program. jPET performs reverse engineering of the test-cases obtained at the byte code level by PET in order to yield this information to the user at the source code level. This allows understanding the information gathered at the lower level and using it to test source Java programs.
