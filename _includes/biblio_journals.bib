abstract={By following a rely-guarantee style of reasoning, we present novel termination and cost analyses for concurrent programs that, in order to prove termination or infer the cost of a considered loop: (1) infer the termination/cost of each loop as if it were a sequential one, imposing assertions on how shared-data is modified concurrently; and then (2) prove that these assertions cannot be violated infinitely many times and, for cost analysis, infer how many times they are violated. At the core of the analysis, we use a may-happen-in-parallel analysis to restrict the set of program points whose execution can interleave. Interestingly, the same kind of reasoning can be applied to prove termination and infer upper bounds on the number of iterations of loops with concurrent interleavings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to automatically bound the cost of such kind of loops. We have implemented our analysis for an actor-based language, and showed its accuracy and efficiency by applying it on several typical applications for concurrent programs and on an industrial case study.},

  abstract={This article presents a may-happen-in-parallel (MHP) analysis for languages with actor-based concurrency. In this concurrency model, actors are the concurrency units such that, when a method is invoked on an actor a2 from a task executing on actor a1, statements of the current task in a1 may run in parallel with those of the (asynchronous) call on a2, and with those of transitively invoked methods. The goal of the MHP analysis is to identify pairs of statements in the program that may run in parallel in any execution. Our MHP analysis is formalized as a method-level (local) analysis whose information can be modularly composed to obtain application-level (global) information. The information yielded by the MHP analysis is essential to infer more complex properties of actor-based concurrent programs, for example, data race detection, deadlock freeness, termination, and resource consumption analyses can greatly benefit from the MHP relations to increase their accuracy. We report on MayPar, a prototypical implementation of an MHP static analyzer for a distributed asynchronous language.},
