This allows understanding the information gathered at the lower level and using it to test source Java programs.},

Our tool allows analyzing an application and finding out the pairs of statements that can execute in parallel. The information can be displayed by means of a graphical representation of the MHP analysis graph or, in a textual way, as a set of pairs which identify the program points that may run in parallel. The information yield by MayPar can be relevant (1) to spot bugs in the program related to fragments of code which should not run in parallel and also (2) to improve the precision of other analyses which infer more complex properties (e.g., termination and cost).},

Interestingly, SACO is able to infer both liveness (namely termination and resource boundedness) and safety properties (namely deadlock freedom) of programs based on concurrent objects. The system integrates auxiliary analyses such as points-to and may-happen-in-parallel, which are essential for increasing the accuracy of the aforementioned more complex properties. SACO provides accurate information about the dependencies which may introduce deadlocks, loops whose termination is not guaranteed, and upper bounds on the resource consumption of methods.},

  abstract = {We present a novel static analysis for inferring precise complexity bounds of imperative and recursive programs. The analysis operates on cost equations. Therefore, it permits uniform treatment of loops and recursive procedures. The analysis is able to provide precise upper bounds for programs with complex execution flow and multi-dimensional ranking functions. In a first phase, a combination of control-flow refinement and invariant generation creates a representation of the possible behaviors of a (possibly inter-procedural) program in the form of a set of execution patterns. In a second phase, a cost upper bound of each pattern is obtained by combining individual costs of code fragments. Our technique is able to detect dependencies between different pieces of code and hence to compute a precise upper bounds for a given program. A prototype has been implemented and evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

abstract={Resource analysis aims at statically obtaining bounds on the resource consumption of programs in terms of input parameters. A well known approach to resource analysis is based on transforming the target program into a set of cost relations, then solving these into a closed-form bound. In this paper we develop a new analysis for computing upper and lower cost bounds of programs expressed as cost relations. The analysis is compositional: it computes the cost of each loop or function separately and composes the obtained expressions to obtain the total cost. Despite being modular, the analysis can obtain precise upper and lower bounds of programs with amortized cost. The key is to obtain bounds that depend on the values of the variables at the beginning and at the end of each program part. In addition we use a novel cost representation called cost structure. It allows to reduce the inference of complex polynomial expressions to a set of linear problems that can be solved efficiently. We implemented our method and performed an extensive experimental evaluation that demonstrates its power.},

abstract={Concurrent programs can synchronize by means of conditions and/or message passing. In the former, processes communicate and synchronize by means of shared variables that several processes can read and write. In the latter, communication is by sending, receiving and waiting for messages. Condition synchronization is often more efficient but also more difficult to analyze and reason about. In this paper, we leverage an existing may-happen-in-parallel (MHP) analysis, which was designed for a particular form of message passing based on future variables, to handle condition synchronization effectively, thus enabling the analysis of programs that use both mechanisms. This is done by developing a must-have-finished analysis which is used to refine the MHP relations inferred by the original MHP analysis. The information inferred by an MHP has been proven to be essential to infer both safety properties (e.g., deadlock freedom) and liveness properties (termination and resource boundedness) of concurrent programs.},

abstract={By following a rely-guarantee style of reasoning, we present a novel termination analysis for concurrent programs that, in order to prove termination of a considered loop, makes the assumption that the “shared-data that is involved in the termination proof of the loop is modified a finite number of times”. In a subsequent step, it proves that this assumption holds in all code whose execution might interleave with such loop. At the core of the analysis, we use a may-happen-in-parallel analysis to restrict the set of program points whose execution can interleave with the considered loop. Interestingly, the same kind of reasoning can be applied to infer upper bounds on the number of iterations of loops with concurrent interleavings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to automatically bound the cost of such kind of loops.},

abstract={We present a novel deadlock analysis for concurrent objects based on the results inferred by a points-to analysis and a may-happen-in-parallel (MHP) analysis. Similarly to other analysis, we build a dependency graph such that the absence of cycles in the graph ensures deadlock freeness. An MHP analysis provides an over-approximation of the pairs of program points that may be running in parallel. The crux of the method is that the analysis integrates the MHP information within the dependency graph in order to discard unfeasible cycles that otherwise would lead to false positives. We argue that our analysis is more precise and/or efficient than previous proposals for deadlock analysis of concurrent objects. As regards accuracy, we are able to handle cases that other analyses have pointed out as challenges. As regards efficiency, the complexity of our deadlock analysis is polynomial.},

In this concurrency model, objects are the concurrency units such that, when a method is invoked on an object o2 from a task executing on object o1, statements of the current task in o1 may run in parallel with those of the (asynchronous) call on o2, and with those of transitively invoked methods. The goal of the MHP analysis is to identify pairs of statements in the program that may run in parallel in any execution. Our MHP analysis is formalized as a method-level (local) analysis whose information can be modularly composed to obtain application-level (global) information.},
