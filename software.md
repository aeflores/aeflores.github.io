### [CoFloCo](http://aeflores.github.io/CoFloCo/) ([github](https://github.com/aeflores/CoFloCo))

I developed CoFloCo, a static analysis tool to infer automatically symbolic complexity upper and lower bounds of imperative and recursive programs. CoFloCoâ€™s analysis is not binded to any specific programming language, instead it takes an abstract representation of programs as an input. The abstract representation is a set of cost equations that can be generated from source code, bytecode or other intermediate representations.

### [SACO](http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/web/saco.php)

I participated in the development of SACO,  a static analyzer for concurrent objects. It analyzes programs written in [ABS](http://abs-models.org/)
and performs the following static analyses:

* [Termination and Resource analysis](https://aeflores.github.io/publication/2017/06/01/AlbertFGM17/)
* [Deadlock analysis](https://aeflores.github.io/publication/2013/06/01/FloresAG13/)

In addition, SACO performs auxiliary static analyses:
